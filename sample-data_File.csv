Dear Nile:
Truely it lias been too long since I last wrote you. How time gets away when you
fail to seize it firmly for those things that ought to ""be done. This letter will
""bring us up to ate on quite a number of items.
Under separate cover I have moiled you several clippings, mostly about the recent
basketball games. A  careful perusal, if you have the time', will give you the
picture better than 1 can describe it. George performed very well, I believe, and
carried his end of the load with credit. How, I hope that he will gather up the
somewhat frayed ends of his scholastic strings and whip them into a sort cf lifeline that will afford him an anchor more durable than the ephemeral plaudits of
the bleachers. Also enclosed are some other items that X  thought might be of
interest to you. The cartoon fro^ the Tribune seemed pat, and I gathered it on
my jaunt into Iowa.  In no other manner do I represent that the Tribune reflects
jiy views. By and large, it is one of the sinister influences in thX^landj(dLl^o-M\
V.'e have discussed means by which you might indicate to us your ports of call,
without giving information to those who should not have it. You may pass judgment
on the suggestion that I enclose - which is a list of 31 places over the globe
where you might be, sonner or later,  I have kept an identical list, and if you
use a number in any manner either in the first paragraph or tho last paragraph
of your letter, we will understand that you will be, are or shall be, at the point
corresponding to that name, or reasonably near to it. A comment like, ""I wrote
you on the 11th"", would mean that you have been at Cuba, possibly the &avy baBe
there. Past tense could mean that you have been there; present tense that you
are there now, and futta tense th^t you are headed in that direction.  If you
think the plan has merit, and is permissable at all under censorship rulfcs, I
know that we would appreciate such information as you can give us.
Your last money orders were deposited and I at the same time withdrew .;>86.73
for the following purposes:
Income tax   $?5.PF     books: Glimpses of L'orld History  $4,00
uniforms     22.OQ lestiny of '.Vest. World     3.00
bond 18.75 Stry of Confederacy       1.39
Story of Heconstruction    1.39
L.'e shall follow your instructions about depositing your remittances coming
direct from the pay-roll allotment, for bonds, church, etc. There are three
iTore payments due on your uniforms, two for $2? and one for a smaller amount.
I have been in touch with Lfottdhewe Book Store in ""egard to the volumes that you
want. Enclosed is a list of the Churchill books prepared by I.Iiss 0*Leary with
whom I have been dealing there, and the ones that I find on our shelves have
een checked with pencil. We also have ""Roving Commission"" but it is marked
for George,  If you want me to order each of the others, please indicate, The
Vvorld Crisis volumes cover three periods and cone In four volumes, or may be
had in one volume, a. letter from the publisher, Scrihner's, states that the
one volume edition ""does not contain all the material in the four volume set,
but it does contain all of the essential fects."" Perhaps you should say which
you prefer. How about the ""Marlborough-6 vols.""?
You have two volumes of Lincoln's biography, ""The Prairie Years"",  I understand
that you want me to buy the other Sandburg volumes of that biography. Also I
eelieve there Is a single volume containing all of the kno'-vn writings by Lincoln,
but I do not have the author's name at hand. We will keep working on this
delegation and will execute it to the best of our ability.
I bought and presented a couple of books this past week. A current edition of
Webster's Collegiate Dictionory to the flovarik hoys, Joe and Jack, v/ith an",23
http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/utils/getfile/collection/kinnick/id/2124/filename/2292.jpg,Page 02,kinnick_2234_2124,http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/kinnick/id/2124,Not Started,,24
http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/utils/getfile/collection/kinnick/id/2125/filename/2293.jpg,Page 03,kinnick_2234_2125,http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/kinnick/id/2125,Not Started,"appropriate message on the fly-leaf. They are fine boys and seem to be doing aO
very well in their school work and in other school activities it is a pleasure
to add some encouragement to their ambitions. Then, I presented my friend Hastain
with a copy of I3artlett's compendium. He had told me some time ago that his wife
gave ills old copy to the Salvation Army some yeers ago, and he loves to quote.
George spent the e-ening down at the ""Y"" refereeing some basketball games in a
tournament. A  moment ago I measured him and he is just under 5* 11"", and he said
Stat he weighed 160 lbs down at the ""Y"".  I wish that I could say with confidence
that his mental stature is keeping pace. With basketball over ami track activities
a little way off, we hope to encourage some concentration on the books, which
will not be misplaced I am sure. He is expecting to go to sunsuer school to
qualify for graduation this summer, as perhaps mother has mentioned, Jin Illtchell
has written George that he is finishing high school early and is leaving this
week for Alaska with the Kaiters on their f-rawelling job. They have a contract
for 200 miles of surfacing on the Alcan Highway, which will take about nine
months. Jim end a Ksimvater boy will be cook's helpers.
It looks to me like investment in farm land is hardly the deal for your funds now.
Land is looking up, rather rapid y in some spots, end it is definitely a sellers
market. Your funds are hardly sufficient to b\jy anything decent except on a
shoestring, and this is Irrdly the tij&e for that. There will come another time
to a few years when conditions will favor the buyer, and without doubt you will
then be in a better position to deol for a farm. As you suggest, I would favor
some good stock like Penn B3U  If Frank Williams has a suggestion that you want
to follow, we will work with him, or if he doesn't want to make a suggestion, I
know a good man here in Cmaha whom I would trust.  I believe that your money
ought to be at better interest than in the savings account, and with watchful
management it ought to yield some $re$et! margin of profit if the inflationary
trend continues, and most seem to concede that it will. There is a possibility
of ceilings or st'->p-trading orders, if the market shows signs of getting out of
hand.  Indications a-e that workers with money are in the stock markets now.
I shall write to the man who owns the eighty just south of grandma's place, and
ask tfent.h* get in touch with us at r.ny future time when he contemplates selling.
That eighty would go well with the farm, if it stays in the family, and it might.
Yesterday I received notice that the subscription to FORTIHE had been received,
and to-day the first copy came, the February issue.  I shall enjoy all of them
and will be grateful to Jou. Ey the way, I placed the sub thru one of the girls
in the office and had the benefit of the agency rate, $7.00. Therefore, I send
you the three frogskins as rebate.
Uncle Chas had a article in lest week's News which was a copy of a paper he
read to the Bt*ry Cluh lately. It is a good one, and I shall see that you have
it to read.
I have saved the SEP article that you nentioned some time ago, and also all of the
Rockwell pictures with accompanying texts. They are fine, but I still think iiie
first one on Freedom of Speech Is the best.  The lrsst one ooraes nest. The one
on Religion or Worship, appealed to me least.
You asked about the FCA set-up for emergency loans thru the RACC. The Post
Bsummary is about right, according to rry judgment.  I can't see the necessity
under present conditions, but they are tearing their hair to get that money
out. .Banks and other sourcos of credit are perfectly able to handle all of the
short term requirements. There must be several cracks in the planning board,
and one of them is this revival of KACC.",25

that spring is only around the cornerj then the mercury will plummet and, like
the last couple of days will be accompanied by a sash rattling wind. That is
often the schedule here in March, as you may recall.  Day before yesterday we
had robins in the back yard, and I heard one as long as three weeks ago. The
signs indicate that Nature will again soon stir herself and thrust up those
evidences of the ever recurring cycle of life and abundance. I find $y head
full of plans relating to rotations, planting schedules and production goals -
just as if I were operating several hundred acres.  That would be my choice
if it had to be one thing.
The Hobbs called last Sunday aft. No more word from Bob. All of us were wondering
about his cryptic remark, ""I may be back about the time that Kile leaves."" But
we find no logical answer. Elsie is awaiting her orders for officers training at
Northampt&n (Smith College)as she has been accepted by the Waves. Mrs. Hobbs said
that the second Bloon girl, the scientist who has been working in the brewery in
Louisville, also expects to be at Smith for the same training.
I am. somewhat at loss in understanding why your gunnery gives su much trouble.
As I understand the problem it is one of proper ""lead"", and you know the general
principles there from all the passes that you have tossed. Maybe it is much more
complicated, but I have every confidence that your usual manner of attacking the
puzzle will get the necessary result. Coordination of mind and muscle has been
your stock in trade for quite awhile.  So, keep working on it, and, like you, I
know that the word will appear.
We are planning on having the Whites over for dinner soon, maybe Friday of this
week. That will give us first hand news of both Ellie and You.
Mother has written you I think about one of us coming back to see you before you
go to sea. Do you believe it is practical? Mother would be the one to come but
she has lately expressed herself to the effect that I am the more logical choice
because of perhaps fitting into the male routine better. You can pass judgment
on that better than we can. We shall adjust ourselves to your wishes.
Love  Pop",27

Dear SB:
Your letter of April 1 requested that your savings account book be sent to Frank
Williams, and I mailed it the same evening your letter was received. To-day I
have It returned with a note from Mr. Williams saying simply that he had purchased
your stock in accordance with instructions. One deduction was for $42,41 and
probably re resents the IHC stock.  The other deduction was for $2ol,36 and no
dombt is for the PP stock. The book also shows interest credits for $21.45 for the
last three six-months periods. The refining balance is $534,4o.
In a recent letter I gave you the balance in your Omaha savings account at $1,183.01.
At that time I reported the withdrawal of $86.78 for listed items, leaviigthe balance
noted here. This week I shall draw about $F0 to pay the regular $22 on your uniforms
and between $27 & $28 to pay for the books ordered for you some time ago, Including
Kie four volumes of Sandburg's ""War Years"", and the Churchill volumes that you asked
for. The books mentioned in your letter of !,Tarch 27th (Van Loon's lives-This Is I,$r
Best-on Jefferson etc) have not been ordered, but I shall attend to it presently.
You will be a busy man catching up on your reading after this is over, but we have
only approbation for your judgment in building your library now.
ATsout making an investment of part of your Omaha funds, I shall attend to that soon,
in the manner we have mentioned in our recent letters. This has been a particularly
busy week and I haven't had much tine for private enterprises. I have had char{je of
a training school at the bank in which we have had# about a dozen NFLA secretaries
and field men in here for conferences end instruction. That will close tomorrow and
should permit me to resume attention to some of the little chores that need doing.
You spoke 10 a recent letter of your wish that we might collaborate in some business
some time. That proposal struck a concordant note In me, and I feel genuinely complimented that you g&ould make it. Nothing would please me more than to join you
in an endeavor tha'ryieTd profit and pleasure to us both, providing the enterprise
would be such that I oould make some real contribution to its success. That would
almost confine it to something agricultural. So you may count on me for that,
'when this is over*.  It would please me no end to serve as the production manager
of an agrarian establishment while you might periodically be away fighting the
political, legislative and governmental wars; then coming home to the quiet industry
of field and feedlotj exchanging the hurly-burly of human strife and congestion for
the feel of new furrows, the fragrance of hay and ripening grain and the hungry grunts
of kine and shoat, Tho the usual gsjege of one's station in this civilized world is
cue's ability to speak a smart line,and a demonstrable savvy of when to bow and when
to look aside. Well, I think it is ft distinct relief to sometimes commune with the
whispering corn a&& the waving grass.  In other words, I shall never feel at loss
as long as there is the land to lean on.  I think you have some of the same ur^e.
April 3d is my birthday, and thanks for remembering. 3en sent up a volume on Texas
history that looks interesting and which I shall read at the very first opportunity,
a small note from Elsie brought her usual and neverfailing recognition. The first
message came frorr- Theodora, and it stimulated me to break out in a raw rash of verse.
Mother laughed uproariously and included your efforts with mine as the object of her
merriment.  I have no excuse to offer, but you know that it is Spring and Theo
could, without too much imagination you know, stir the muses. Don't you agree?
Anyway, you might like to see the lines; as one poet to another. So here they
are.",57

Now I haven't heard, yet, how Theo h?s responded to this bit of ribbing, I trust
that she doesn't regard her incle as unmindful of the more delicate phases of

Enclosed are some clippings that may be of Interest. You need not return any except
the two marked X, The one on the i>ed Cross drive may be of interest as I was active
on the speakers bureau.  In eight appearances I spoke before one group of laundry
workers (certainly the most uninspiring bunch of women I ever saw, and^disrespect
meant). Art Swanson's Cook Paint outfit, one shoe store, Isard's painters working
in the U.P, shops and another &*BBLh of the same in the U,P, roundhouse at Council
Bluffs, the Motor Depot at Ak-Sar-Ben Field, Paxton-IUtchell machine shop (where they
are making ship parts for the navy) and the employes of Skinner lURcaroni. Very
interesting and apparently helpful in most instances. The drive started off poorly
and the early response was $$## small, especially where they had no speakers. After
the emphasis was made thru the speakers things picked up and the goal was made without much trouble.
The cookies that you received are partly due to the thoughtfullness of Reese Hastaln.
The butter rationing wes.imposed without warning and caught us a trifle short. The
news appeared on the aedLeo  one Stxndey afternoon and, upon peaking in the icebox
mother discovered less then a half pound to last the ensuing week. She at once
dispatched George to find another pound. He was gone an hour and came back empty
handed. Eeese had 16 lbs in his freezer locker and gave me a pound, which I took
with the understanding that cookies would go to the armed forces.
The Old lassouri is on the swell a.min, and they say this one will rival the flood
of 1881, when Carter Lake w^s cut off. We haven't been down to see, but it really
is something. The upper Missouri area had a rather heavy snow fall about a month
ago, and it all melted! quickly with the coming of warm weather about ten days ago.
Therefore, most of that snowfall ran Into the river at the same time. The crest will
not come for three or four days and already it is rather serious.

Going back to the question of Terse; I have thoroughly enjoyed your efforts along
th*t line, and agree that it ought to be good practice in expression. Frankly,
poetry is rather hard for me to comprehend generally speaking. Yours has been
something well within my ken, however. About the best one was when you and Hobbs
went to the show and met the gal who ran out with the last curtain. Then, about
your mess boyj his effort seemed to me quite above What could be expectedAn thought, *
If he actually wrote that he has a mentality above the average mess boy, 'I should say.
Please do not hesitate to burst forth when the muse stirs. Bather likes it too, tho
she carelessly classed you with me in her generalisations the other evening.
Spring really has come to Omaha now. It hae been quite warm for ten days and the
Victory garden idea Is rampant. "" Sturdy' has plowed up part of the vacant lot by
his garage and of course Is busy in it all the time, liy plans are still confined
to a strip along the west side of the back yard - by taking out the row of shrubs
and rion-descript growth which we have been threatening to remove. All that has been
accomplished so far is a few packets of Beeds, George overhauled the yard last
Saturday; mowed down all of the dead growth and prepared the lawn for the fresh, green
growth that delights and benefits man and beast, Did you ever see the re: arks on

that Pres, Tan Home has some for distribution. By the way, nr,-' admiration for him
grows with each contact. He is a real guy and I am sure the best head of this bank
it has ever he?d. Quite a comfort, if you ask me. And along that line, the election
of a prize lame duck to the district high office is not enhancing the reputatfcnn
of these institutions, as indicated by reports coming from the country.
Must run for the office now. Began this last night and now it is Friday morning.
Will write another soon, hoping to beat your time of departure. Wonder if you have
heard from Bob? I saw Bert on the street a week ago and he told me they had received two letters. He has been re-ass^gned to another squadron stationed on the

Dear SB.
First, let me say how pleased and happy I ""m that you are to have the F6F jobs
before you go Into action. That really should equip you well machanieally and
I am pleased no end. Would like to be about when you make your first hop, and
I have assured you before that in spirit I fly with you each time.
Your description of the Newburgh assignment was splendid, and the neat accomplishment
of It must have given you no little satisfaction. We have the impression that your
training has been thorough ana that you have absorbed it in like manner. Please
give us more of those detailed narrations. You have no idea how close home it
brings your activities. One item I couldn't understand; what is an oleo? Sounds
like a shock absorber, but could find no confirmation.  I agree with your comment
on the Beechcraft bi~wing number-  It is really a honey, just looking at it.
In gl ancing over some of your recent letters I find a question or two about the
piece in Time about John Vandevender. Yes, that was John of Dallas County, as
everifled by DC News, That was an excellent piece of descriptive writing, and accurate
even to the weather vane. The riderless horse would constitute the vane and therefore
would hang to the lee side. The accompanying -icture is subject to criticism in my  t   .
-opinion. The sow was a Duroc instead of a Chester White, and that picture was surely
taken in the  corner of a small portable house instead of In a barn.. The floor was dirt
and the construction of the walls was definitely small house style Instead of barn.
But that should not detract from the high merit of the article.
Your letter of March 23d is devoted mostly to comments on the booklet Peace & War.
Your conclusions are like those expressed In an editorial in the Register several
weeks ago. Tho I haven't read this booklet I agree completely with your appraisal
of the present administration. You have heard me say more than once that FDR doesn't
draw a breath without considering the political implications of it.  I am glad that
you recognize so clearly that character in government is as important as character
in person. Neither can be great or really successful without it. And that is where
our government suffers most now.
Enclosed is a recent clip ing from the Register by Lippman. Probably you have seen
it but just in case, I send it as an encouraging expression of a writer whom I
admire concerning an able man who should be the next leader of this republic. You
suggest that popular opinion mey again override the wishes of the old line Republic ans,
aid I believe that may very well happen.  It seems there is a strong tide running that
way, and tho Brisker Is getting quite a play, he will never make It If the Isolationist
tag can be pinned on him.  I h-'te to see the party split but there should be no
compromise on that issue.
Rainy last Saturday, and cloudy to-day with rrospects for more showers. The rain
will do a world og good as the top soil was getting pretty dry in Nebraska. The
river continues to rise. We (mother, grandma and I) took a little ride this aft and
viewed the swollen stream from the Douglas bridge, E^st Omaha Is largely under water
end there is some danger to the airport. The crest is expected about Tuesday so the
papers state, and I shall enclose some clippings.
Things seem pretty good in the old homestead. Grandma seems quite contented and
comfortable. Bother has had a very busy rr^ctice lately. George appears to be tying
into the school work with some greater interest. Ify  affairs are normal tho it seems
there is a large demand on time, with ohurch meetings and other affairs leaving me
too little for reading. With the fiBcal year now completed the trend mpy ease away now.

June 6, 1943
My dear Mr. and Mrs. Kinnick,
It is with deepest regret and sympathy that I inform you of
the loss of your son, Nile, in an airplane crash on the second of June
1943. Nile was engaged in a practice flight that took off from the U.S.S.
LEXINGTON about eight-thirty on the morning of the second of June and
remained with his flight until he was forced to land in the water about
an hour and twenty minutes later. His plane developed d a serious oil leak
about ten minutes before he landed. Having lost all oil the engine, with-
out lubrication, failed, forcing Nile to land in the water. Nile made a
normal unhurried water landing in calm water about four miles ahead and in
full view of the ship. He was seen by one of his team mates to get clear
of the plane. Both the Lexington and the plane guard boat proceeded dir
ectly to the scene of the landing, which had been kept under constant
observation, both from the air and from the ship, and was further definitely
identified as being the exact location by gasoline and paint chips in the
water, arriving at the spot about eight minutes later. A  diligent and
immediate search of the exact location of the landing and the adjacent
waters, by both planes and ships, failed to reveal any trace whatever of
Nile. Since Nile was definitely not on the surface of the water eight
minutes after he landed and at no time for the next hour and a half, it
must be assumed that he drowned. Knowing Nile to be a very good swimmer,
an excellent athlete, and in wonderful physical condition, it is inconceiv
able that he could have failed to remain afloat for the short period of
time required for the crash boat to arrive unless he  had been seriously
hurt in the landing itself.

I would like to emphasize the fact that there can be no doubt
whatever that the exact spot of Nile's landing was very throughly searched
both by ships and planes immediately following the landing. A water landing
is normally a relatively safe landing, especially under conditions of calm
water. There is small probability of serious physical injury in such a
landing. It is very difficult to understand just what could have gone wrong.
The best guess, and it is nothing more than a guess, is that his safety belt
broke on landing allowing Nile to lurch forward upon impact probably striking
his head on the structure of the airplane and injuring him to the extent
that he could neither maintain himself afloat nor remember to inflate his
life jacket.

Nile was an outstanding man in every respect. His calm and
determined manner, his quick grin, his sound common sense, and his outstand-
ing all around abilities made him a wonderful asset to the squadron and a
man that we were all proud to call our friend. His loss was a terrible
blow to all of us and a serious loss to the country he so ably served.",111

Dear Sir:
May  we thank you sincerely for your letters in regard to file's
tragic accident. The information given has ""been helpful to a
degree to our understanding of what happened. However, it is
likely we shall never know definitely the real reason why he
was unable to save himself after his landing,
Yfe did not disclose any of the information included in your
first letter, but we have noted in the press a story which
must have been based on the same information. It will be appreciated if you will clarify one point for us. You stated
that his landing was made about four miles ahead of the carrier.
Do we assume correctly that his flight group had been on a
practice flight ahead of the carrier and that the loss of oil
pressure was noted at such distance from the ship that he lacked
four miles of getting back to the carrier? It seems probable
that he would attempt to return as soon as the difficulty was
notedj otherwise, we cannot understand how he oould be four miles
away when he was forced to land.
Hay we acknowledge the receipt of his wallet and its contents as
given on the inventory of his effects.
In regard to Nile's other .property, I am enclosing a copy of the
inventory sent to us with your letter of June 11th., and will
ask that you forward all of the items indicated with a check
mark. The other items, all of which are clothing, may be disposed of and the proceeds remitted to us. Your kindness in this
regard will be appreciated.
Yours very truly,

Dear Mr. Kinnick,
In clarification of the point raised in your recent letter, Nile,
accompanied by another plane, was making a wide circle of the ship to
avoid interference with the launching of a second group of planes, then
spotted on the flight deck. When it became imminent that he would have
to make a forced landing, he was flying a course parallel to that of the
ship, approximately 2^ miles broad on the starboard how. As the ship was
running into the wind, the only course that Nile could take with a failing motor, was to continue in the same direction, in order to assure a.
relatively safe water lajiding. To attempt returning to the ship at that
time, even if the flight deck had been clear, was entirely out of the
question.
In regard to the personal effects of Nile, which are at present in
the custody of the Supply Officer aboard the ship, there will be insufficient time before sailing to dispose of the articles requested.
Accordingly I have taken the only alternative, and ordered the entire
lot forwarded directly to you which action I hope meets with your approval. It is regrettable that time does not permit complete fullfillment of
your wish, but again I want to ask you to call on me for any further
assistance that I might be able to offer.
Very sincerely yours
Paul D.

Dear Judge Stuart:
I hasten to thank you for your long and helnful letter in regard to
Nile Kinnick.     Perhaps I told you earlier that I have exchanged several
letters with Nile,  Sr.  and also several with Dr.  Eddie.     It has been a
deeply moving and enriching experience for me.     Maury White has sent some
helpful material as have several members  of the team.    Your letter,  of
course,  is the most personal and helpful of all.     I imagine it is hard
for you to discuss Nile's death as I am sure the whole subject must be
for his father; however, we've had good times exchanging information
about the family in and around Adel and Van Mater.     I look forward to
putting together the article prior to State's game with Iowa this Sent.
It is also a tremendous responsibility to do justice to Nile and his
teammates and friends.  I Do you remember his model ""T"" ? J
To answer your question about Mrs,   Kinnick,  Nile said that she died about
1965 .     He is presently married to a women who is descended from Will
Van Meter for whome' the town is named.    % great-grandfather settled
there in 18^3 and was the first white man in Dallas  County and I grew
up in Van Meter so this is meaningful to me.     By the way,  Nile's mother's
grandfather,  (Benjamin Greene   (Nile had a brother Ben who was Marine air
and was also killed,  perhaps you know this) named the towa of Adel.
In researching Nile's life I feel as if I'm treading on hallowed ground.
I've made a hobby of Civil Wr history and I find this same feeling when
visiting the old battlefields and reading biographies.     I know Nile, Sr.
would be delighted to hear from you.     I understand from the librarian at
(please turn over)",1

for Nile,     I believe his folks discouraged this in the late forties because
they felt that lots of other boys had given their litfes for their country
and it would be unfair to single out Nile,     Perhaps they (Nile,  Sr. ) would
think differently now.     I do hope,   if they do it, and if he wants this,
that it will be while he is yet alive.     He is in his mid-seventies now.
Did you know that Nile,   Sr. was quarterback for Iowa State about the time
George  Clarke was Governor?    His address  is ^23 South 89th St.,  Omaha,
Nebraska 6811-4-.
Nile and I are related on both sides of the family,  but not so close that
it violates or perpetrates consanguinity.     Not that a taboo such as that
ever phased the country folk of Iowa!    I am struck by the sheer coincidence
of our lives   (mine much less distinguished)...! was catcher on the Van Meter
baseball team,  guard on the basketball team and an officer on an aircraft
carrier though not Naval Air.  (I went to Drake, where Nile's mother attended and was an ATO.) I do have a slight cleft in the chin which must be a     ft
family characteristic,  though Nile's was more pronounced./ Your description
of his shaving etc. was delightful.    Can you still do as many Dusb-ups?
J have two sons who use the exercise bar for pull ups and your descriotAon
has caused a great fDiurry of activity in that direction.
Peter Bergman Narey (son of the late Hon.  Harry Narey of Spirit Lake) is the
godfather of my Bill and might have been at Iowa when you and Nile were there.
I plan to write Pete and ask him if he remembers Nile.
John Henry Erizzell a close friend here  (he's about 90) was a great Phi Psi
and Ires.  John W.  Oswald of Perm State is also a Phi Psi alum.    Well I've       j.V
rambled and am out of paper so I'll close.    Ever sincerely,  thankfully,   Jjr'",3
